=head1 ATTRIBUTES

B<< All attributes are C<required> and C<ro> by default. >>

=head2 property

This defaults to C<1> and marks the attribute as ElasticSearch
property and thus will be added to mapping. If you set this
to C<0> the attribute will act as a traditional Moose attribute.

=head2 id

Usually there is one property which also acts as id for the whole
document. If there is no attribute with the C<id> option defined
ElasticSearch will assign a random id. This option can either
be set to a true value or an arrayref. The former will make the
value of the attribute the id. The latter will generate a SHA1
digest of the concatenated values of the attributes listed in 
the arrayref.

Only one attribute with the C<id> option set can be present in 
a document.

=head2 type

Most of the time L<ElasticSearchX::Model::Document::Mapping> will take 
care of this option and set the correct value based on the
type constriant. In case it doesn't know what to do, this 
value will be used as the type for the attribute. Defaults
to C<string>.

=head2 parent

The value of this property will be used as C<parent> id.
Since the parent id is stored in the C<_parent> field, it
is adviced to set L</source_only> to C<1> to prevent the
field to be stored redundantly.

=head1 PASS THROUGH ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes are passed thorugh - as is - to the
type mapping.

=head2 store

Defaults to C<yes>.

=head2 boost

=head2 index

=head2 dynamic

By default, properties are not dynamic. That means that fields that
are unknown to the ElasticSearch mapping will not be indexed and
no dynamic mapping will be auto generated. Since the mapping is
generated by this module, there is no need to have the dynamic
mapping enabled. If you want to enable it anyway, set this attribute
to C<1> value.

This will change the behaviour of C<HashRef> attributes.
Instead of deflating to a JSON string they will be stored as object
in ElasticSearch.

=head2 analyzer

If this attribute or L</index> is set to C<analyzed>, the field is stored
both analyzed and not analyzed. The not analyzed field can be accessed in
queries by the field name. The analyzed field will have a C<.analyzed>
postfix if there is only one analyzer. If there are more than one analyzer,
the C<.analyzed> postfix refers to the first analyzer. For all other
analyzers, its name is prefixed. This is done by using the C<multi_field>
feature of ElasticSearch.

=head2 include_in_all

=head2 include_in_parent

=head2 include_in_root

=head2 term_vector

=head2 not_analyzed

By default, a field is not analyzed. That means the raw value is stored
in the field. To add analyzed fields, either set L</index> to C<analyzed>
or add an L</analyzer>. Set this to C<0> if you don't want to store
the not analyzed version of this field along with the analyzed.
